## Breaking changes

**Note**: Breaking changes processed up to PR 98609

{% details "BMW Connected Drive" %}

The "Refresh from cloud" button has been removed. Use the
`homeassistant.update_entity` service with any BMW entity for a
full reload instead.

([@rikroe] - [#97864]) ([documentation](/integrations/bmw_connected_drive))

[@rikroe]: https://github.com/rikroe
[#97864]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/97864

{% enddetails %}

{% details "DoorBird" %}

The `doorbird_reset_favorites` event is no longer fired when the clear webhook
is called. Note: this event was never documented.

([@bdraco] - [#98585]) ([documentation](/integrations/doorbird))

[@bdraco]: https://github.com/bdraco
[#98585]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/98585

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Enphase Envoy" %}

Envoy versions < 3.9 (pre-API) are no longer supported as they require
web scraping which is disallowed by [ADR-0004](https://github.com/home-assistant/architecture/blob/master/adr/0004-webscraping.md).

([@bdraco] - [#97862]) ([documentation](/integrations/enphase_envoy))

[@bdraco]: https://github.com/bdraco
[#97862]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/97862

{% enddetails %}

{% details "ESPHome" %}

To prevent cross-linked devices, replacing an ESPHome device with a different
board is no longer allowed. Instead, delete the integration entry and re-add
the new device when the mac address of the board changes.

([@bdraco] - [#98787]) ([documentation](/integrations/esphome))

[@bdraco]: https://github.com/bdraco
[#98787]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/98787

{% enddetails %}

{% details "EZVIZ" %}

Now, only returns switches if supported by the Camera. Some of the "switches" on
the EZVIZ API are intermingled with "is this supported" and are not actually
switchable; those have been removed.

([@RenierM26] - [#95672]) ([documentation](/integrations/ezviz))

[@RenierM26]: https://github.com/RenierM26
[#95672]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/95672

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Flume" %}

You might get false positives for leak detected and high flow sensors if you
have old unread notifications in the Flume app.

Before, the leak detected and high flow sensors would only trigger until you
read the notification in the Flume app which was too late for Home Assistant
to take any automated action.

Now, they trigger regardless if you have read or not the notification. They will
remain active until you delete the notification in the Flume app,
similar to [the old behavior documented](/integrations/flume/#notifications).

([@tronikos] - [#98560]) ([documentation](/integrations/flume))

[@tronikos]: https://github.com/tronikos
[#98560]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/98560

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Hive" %}

The previously deprecated service `hive.boost_heating` has been removed.

([@gjohansson-ST] - [#97444]) ([documentation](/integrations/hive))

[@gjohansson-ST]: https://github.com/gjohansson-ST
[#97444]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/97444

{% enddetails %}

{% details "HTTP / Webserver" %}

Home Assistant can't be put in an iframe anymore by default. If you still want
to embed the Home Assistant interface in a frame, you can do so by disabling
`use_x_frame_options` by setting it to `false` in the `http` configuration.

([@frenck] - [#97784]) ([documentation](/integrations/http))

[@frenck]: https://github.com/frenck
[#97784]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/97784

{% enddetails %}

{% details "M√©t√©o-France" %}

The M√©t√©o-France weather entities have been updated:

- The `forecast` state attribute is deprecated and will be removed in
  Home Assistant Core 2024.3, you should instead use the `weather.get_forecast`
  service.
- The config entry option to select hourly or daily forecast can no longer be
  adjusted, but any existing configuration of the forecast period will be
  respected until Home Assistant Core 2024.3.
- M√©t√©o-France now provides a single weather entity which supports both
  hourly and daily forecast.

([@emontnemery] - [#98022]) ([documentation](/integrations/meteo_france))

[@emontnemery]: https://github.com/emontnemery
[#98022]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/98022

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Mill" %}

Mill has moved to a new IoT solution and released a new API. The unique ID from
the old API is no longer available, so all devices will be shown as new devices.
Support for the heater fan will be added later.

([@Danielhiversen] - [#97497]) ([documentation](/integrations/mill))

[@Danielhiversen]: https://github.com/Danielhiversen
[#97497]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/97497

{% enddetails %}

{% details "MQTT" %}

MQTT device trackers no longer always update the when there is no state change.
This means that automations that trigger on a state change no longer are
triggered if there is no change.

([@jbouwh] - [#98838]) ([documentation](/integrations/mqtt))

[@jbouwh]: https://github.com/jbouwh
[#98838]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/98838

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Nextcloud" %}

The CPU load sensor has been replaced, it is not a list of 3 values anymore,
but there are now three single sensors for
CPU load within last 1, 5, and 15 minutes. 

([@mib1185] - [#99141]) ([documentation](/integrations/nextcloud))

[@mib1185]: https://github.com/mib1185
[#99141]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/99141

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Plugwise" %}

The `maximum_boiler_temperature` sensor entity has been replaced by a number
entity, allowing control as well.

([@CoMPaTech] - [#97203]) ([documentation](/integrations/plugwise))

[@CoMPaTech]: https://github.com/CoMPaTech
[#97203]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/97203

---

The additional schema state attributes of the climate entity have been removed.
They have beeen previously replaced by a select entity.

([@bouwew] - [#98153]) ([documentation](/integrations/plugwise))

[@bouwew]: https://github.com/bouwew
[#98153]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/98153

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Start.ca" %}

Start.ca `limit`, `usage`, and `used_remaining` sensors will no longer be created
when there's no bandwidth cap.

([@emontnemery] - [#98525]) ([documentation](/integrations/startca))

[@emontnemery]: https://github.com/emontnemery
[#98525]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/98525

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Trafikverket Train" %}

All attributes have been converted into their own sensors.
The original sensor is now renamed with suffix "Departure time".

Any automation or script depending on these attributes needs to be adjusted
to use these new sensors.

([@gjohansson-ST] - [#71432]) ([documentation](/integrations/trafikverket_train))

[@gjohansson-ST]: https://github.com/gjohansson-ST
[#71432]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/71432

{% enddetails %}

{% details "Z-Wave" %}

The entity naming logic has been updated to be less brittle. As a result,
some `zwave_js` entities that you haven't given a custom name to may be renamed.

Since they are registered in the entity registry, the entity IDs will not change
and your automations should therefore not be impacted by the change.

([@raman325] - [#98140]) ([documentation](/integrations/zwave_js))

[#98140]: https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/98140
